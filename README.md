## Additional features(bonus)
- Implemented a tables library ( more like spreadsheet library)
- Proper keyboard navigation just like google sheets
- Resizable columns 
- Added columns types for better formatting
- Import/Export button functionality for excel files
- Customizable column colours
- Integrated search functionality
### tradeoffs
- Some minor parts of UI were skipped as it does not suit the interactive design
- No data is presisted
- Such apps can have a complex state managment and should use a library like redux
